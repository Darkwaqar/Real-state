                        make
                        browsing information available to third party ad companies (through third party tags on
                        our
                        Sites) in order to improve and measure our ad campaigns and reach users with more
                        relevant ads
                        and content. This sharing can constitute “sales” under the CCPA.

                        The categories of Personal Information that we may have shared in a manner that is
                        considered a
                        “sale” as defined under CCPA in the prior twelve (12) months include: identifiers;
                        internet or
                        other electronic network activity information; geolocation information; and inferences.
                        The
                        categories of third parties under the CCPA to whom we have shared data that can be
                        considered a
                        “sale” of personal information as defined under the CCPA in the past twelve (12) months
                        are data

                        Personal
                        Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those
                        rights.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Right to Know</h5>

                    <p>

                        collection
                        and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and
                        confirm your
                        request, we will disclose to you:

                        You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we
                        collected
                        from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your
                        request,
                        we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information
                        from our
                        records, unless an exception applies.

                        We may not be able to honor your deletion request if retaining the information is
                        necessary for
                        us or our service provider(s) to:

                    <h5>Exercising Your Right to Know and Right to Delete</h5>

                    <p>
                        To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, please submit your request
                        to us
                        at <a href="mailto:privacy@aris.com">privacy@aris360.com</a> , or contact us in
                        writing at
                        the address listed below in this Privacy
                        Notice. Only you, or an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of
                        State that
                        you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a consumer request related to your
                        Personal
                        Information. You may also make a consumer request on behalf of your minor child (12 and
                        under).
                        If you have any questions about your access or deletion rights described above, you may
                        also
                        contact us via email or regular mail at the contact information contained below in this
                        Privacy
                        Notice.
                    </p>

                    <p>You may only make a Right to Know request twice within a 12-month period.</p>

                    <p>
                        We cannot respond to your request to delete or provide you with Personal Information if
                        we
                        cannot verify your identity or your authority to make the request and confirm the
                        Personal
                        Information relates to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to
                        verify the
                        requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Response Timing and Format</h5>

                    <p>
                        Where possible, we will respond to a verified consumer request within forty-five (45)
                        days of
                        its receipt; however, if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and
                        extension
                        period.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verified
                        consumer
                        request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
                        comply with a
                        request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to
                        provide your
                        Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
                        information
                        from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless
                        it is
                        excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request
                        warrants a fee,
                        we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
                        completing your request.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h5>

                    <p>
                        If you are age 16 or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal
                        information at any time. We do not sell the personal information of consumers we
                        actually know
                        are less than 16 years old.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To exercise your right to opt-out of “sales” of your Personal Information, you can use a

                    <h5>Non-Discrimination</h5>

                    <p>
                        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless
                        permitted by
                        the CCPA, we will not:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="bullet_list">
                        <li>Deny you goods or services. </li>
                        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through
                            granting
                            discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties. </li>
                        <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services. </li>
                        <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a
                            different
                            level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can
                        result in
                        different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we
                        offer,
                        will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value to us and contain written
                        terms that
                        describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program
                        requires
                        your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
