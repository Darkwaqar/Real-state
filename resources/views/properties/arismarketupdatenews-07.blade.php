                   <p>The luxury real estate market is constantly evolving, and it’s important for both buyers and sellers to stay up-to-date on the latest trends. One of the biggest trends in recent years has been a focus on sustainability and eco-friendly features. High-end buyers are increasingly seeking homes with energy-efficient appliances, green building materials, and smart home technology.</p>
                   <p>Another trend is the rise of wellness amenities, such as home gyms, spas, and meditation rooms. Buyers are also looking for homes with outdoor spaces, like private gardens or rooftop terraces.</p>
                   <p>For sellers, staging homes with high-end finishes and unique features can help attract luxury buyers. It’s also important to work with a real estate agent who specializes in the luxury market and understands these trends.</p>
